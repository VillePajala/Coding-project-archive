# League table editor

League Table editor is a simple CRUD -application to manipulate database data. This repository containes 5 separate code folders, all having their separate functionality. The splitting of the code is done simply because this was a school assignment and erxercises were split to smaller chunks. As this repo is here is only for my programming hostory documentation and this application isn't going to be build ever, I decided to leave the structure as it is.
